the following deck is a modified version of [this deck](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseLanguage/comments/7mjmjc/best_anki_deck_for_hsk_ive_come_across/)

it has been modified in the following way:
- added zhuyin readings with the following script
- deleted the simplified words and sentences if they are the same as the traditional one
- compressed (the least possible) the audio and the images to fit into the size restrictions of the shared decks pages 

github repo with the python script and template suggestions (would take too much space here):
