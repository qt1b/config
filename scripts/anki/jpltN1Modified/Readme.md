[original Deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2132581058)

A modified version of the deck, with no javascript as most of it is now broken, and the cards shuffled by default

The main reason for modifying this deck is because the answers were different between the front and the back, and it annoyed me.

The cards were also shuffled for this modified version, but the shuffle is at the note level so it always stays the same.
